👋 Hi, I’m @Bronwen from www.worldofdev.info

👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and ultimately become a full stack dev with a focus on blockchain projects

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and version control by doing projects on https://www.frontendmentor.io/ using the https://replit.com/ tools.

💞️ Current I am not looking to collaborate on any projects, however I am always open to hearing about sites that helped you on your coding journey.

📫 I have decided to document my entire coding journey through a blog. You can find my bolg here: www.worldofdev.info
